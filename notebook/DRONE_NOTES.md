# NOTES FOR THE 5" drones

# ✅ Betaflight Rates (most popular baseline)

These are **Betaflight Rates** (not Actual / not KISS).

## 🎮 Rates tab → “Betaflight” selected

### **Roll**

* **Rate:** `1.00`
* **RC Rate:** `0.70`
* **Expo:** `0.00`

### **Pitch**

* **Rate:** `1.00`
* **RC Rate:** `0.70`
* **Expo:** `0.00`

### **Yaw**

* **Rate:** `0.90`
* **RC Rate:** `0.65`
* **Expo:** `0.00`



---

## 🧠 Why these rates are so popular

* **Expo = 0** → keeps stick response predictable
* **Super Rate** controls max speed without softening center
* **Yaw slightly slower** → reduces over-rotation & toilet-bowling
* Works well with **thumbs or hybrid grip**

---

# ✅ Throttle Setup (very important)

### 🔧 Rates tab → Throttle section

* **Throttle Mid:** `0.50`
* **Throttle Expo:** `0.25`

### What this does

* Gives **fine control around hover**
* Makes throttle less twitchy on small stick movements
* Very helpful with lighter quads & Pocket gimbals


# ✅ Deadband (for completeness)

From earlier, still recommended:

```
Roll:     3 (0.03)
Pitch:    3 (0.03)
Yaw:      5 (0.05)
Throttle: 0
```
